# credit-risk-classification
in this analysis, i aimed to determine the creditworthiness of borrowers. i utilized historical lending data to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan is likely to be healthy or at high risk of defaulting.

resaults:

accuracy score: my model accurately predicts the loan status 99% of the time, which is a highly impressive rate.

precision:

for healthy loans: when my model predicts a loan is healthy, it's spot on 100% of the time.
for high-risk loans: when the model suggests a loan is risky, it's accurate 84% of the time.
recall:

for healthy loans: the model successfully identifies 99% of the actual healthy loans.
for high-risk loans: it's able to capture 99% of the actual high-risk loans, which is essential to minimize potential financial losses.
summary: based on the results, my model is highly effective in predicting both healthy and high-risk loans. given its superior accuracy and the ability to almost flawlessly identify high-risk loans, i would recommend its implementation. it will serve as a trustworthy tool for determining the creditworthiness of borrowers and assist in making informed lending decisions.
